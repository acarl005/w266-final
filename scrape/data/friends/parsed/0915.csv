Chandler,"Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what… Joey: Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?! Monica:  Really?  Let's get past the moment. Phoebe: What's your news? Chandler: Thank you. I got a job in advertising.  Monica:  Oh, honey, that's incredible! Phoebe:  Gosh, what's the pay like?  Oh, come on people…  come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most!  Hey Joey!  Chandler: Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship. Joey: Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'. Chandler: Right. So, it'll be the same except… less sex with you.  Ross: So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there? Chandler: Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like. Phoebe:  That's great. Chandler: Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating  Chandler:  Humiliating and noble!  Ross: You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising. Monica: Ross, you did not come up with ""got milk?"" Ross: Yes, I did, I did!  I should have written it down!"
